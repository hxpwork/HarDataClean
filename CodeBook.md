##Tidy data for 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set'

| Variable Name | Description   |
| ------------- |:--------------|
|Subject        | The subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. Coming from train\subject_train.txt and test\subject_test.txt |
|Activity       | Activity name. Coming from train\y_train.txt and test\y_test.txt, and transform by the data in activity_labels.txt.|
|>tBodyAcc-mean-X| base the avarage value of body acceleration signal in X-axial, than get the avarage value by Subject and Activity. |
|>tBodyAcc-mean-Y| Y-axial, other like up.|
|tBodyAcc-mean-Z| Z-axial, other like up.|
|tBodyAcc-std-X | base the standard deviation value of body acceleration signal in X-axial, than get the avarage value by Subject and Activity. |
|tBodyAcc-std-Y | Y-axial, other like up.|
|tBodyAcc-std-Z | Z-axial, other like up.|
